# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: [September 21st, 2016](https://twitter.com/Programazing/status/778759015748755456)

**Today's Progress**: I deleted the old version of Open School Library from Github and made a new one. I then uploaded a new blank ASP.NET Core project.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't really all that difficult but it took longer than I thought it would to get the ASP.NET Core 1.0.1 update to work with the new project. I mostly spent my time running through configuration files and installing things.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
