# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: [September 21st, 2016](https://twitter.com/Programazing/status/778759015748755456)

**Today's Progress**: I deleted the old version of Open School Library from Github and made a new one. I then uploaded a new blank ASP.NET Core project.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't really all that difficult but it took longer than I thought it would to get the ASP.NET Core 1.0.1 update to work with the new project. I mostly spent my time running through configuration files and installing things.

### Day 2: [September 22nd, 2016](https://twitter.com/Programazing/status/779168747483521026)

**Today's Progress**: I figured out how Code First works and I was able to set up my application so that it will create its own database. I also figured out how to add test data to that database.

**Thoughts**: I really wanted to use Code First because this is an open soruce project. I didn't want other developers relying on the fact that I would remember to upload an sql script to generate an updated version of the database every time I made a change.

I was also happy to learn how to delete then re-create the database from my models every time I started the project and be able to add the same test data to the newly created database. This ability alone was critical for rapid development and testing of my view models, controllers, and views.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
